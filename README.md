# Heroku buildpack for crates.io

This is a custom [Heroku buildpack](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/buildpack-api) for the [crates.io](https://github.com/rust-lang/crates.io) project. 

It is tailored specifically to the crates.io project and should not be used for anything else!

This buildpack is partially derived from https://github.com/Turbo87/heroku-buildpack-rust, which itself was forked from https://github.com/emk/heroku-buildpack-rust.
